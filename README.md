# Brave AI Todolist App

## How this app was created

I was surfing the web, and realized Brave Search has an llm. So I asked it to make a React TodoList App.

### pnpm

pnpm is faster than npm

```sh
# what I did to create this app
npm install -g pnpm

pnpm create vite brave-ai-todolist-app
# selected React and JavaScript in vite prompt>
```

### Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Running app locally

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
