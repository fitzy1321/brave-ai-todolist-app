# Brave AI Todolist App

## How this app was created

I was surfing the web, and realized Brave Search has an llm. So I asked it to make a React TodoList App.

So I entered this prompt into the Brave AI: `generate react app, todo list app with checkbox and saves items to localStorage`

All the code in the `src` folder (except for `src/main.jsx`), was generated by Brave Search AI.

### pnpm

pnpm is faster than npm, and I like new shinies âœ¨

```sh
# what I did to create this app
npm install -g pnpm

pnpm create vite brave-ai-todolist-app
# selected React and JavaScript + SWC in vite prompt>
```

## Running app locally

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
